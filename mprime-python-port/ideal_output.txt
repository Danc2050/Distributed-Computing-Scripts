[Main thread Mar 9 17:26] Mersenne number primality test program version 29.8
[Main thread Mar 9 17:26] Optimizing for CPU architecture: Core i3/i5/i7, L2 cache size: 2x256 KB, L3 cache size: 3 MB

Welcome to GIMPS, the hunt for huge prime numbers.  You will be asked a
few simple questions and then the program will contact the primenet server
to get some work for your computer.  Good luck!

Attention OVERCLOCKERS!!  Mprime has gained a reputation as a useful
stress testing tool for people that enjoy pushing their hardware to the
limit.  You are more than welcome to use this software for that purpose. 
Please select the stress testing choice below to avoid interfering with
the PrimeNet server.  Use the Options/Torture Test menu choice for your
stress tests.  Also, read the stress.txt file.

If you want to both join GIMPS and run stress tests, then Join GIMPS and
answer the questions.  After the server gets some work for you, stop
mprime, then run mprime -m and choose Options/Torture Test.

CPU Information:
Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3340M CPU @ 2.70GHz
CPU speed: 3125.50 MHz, 2 hyperthreaded cores
CPU features: Prefetch, SSE, SSE2, SSE4, AVX

Number of workers to run (1): 

Pick a priority between 1 and 10 where 1 is the lowest priority and 10 is
the highest.  It is strongly recommended that you use the default priority
of 1.  Your throughput will probably not improve by using a higher
priority.  The only time you should raise the priority is when another
process, such as a screen saver, is stealing CPU cycles from this program.
Priority (1): 

Use the following values to select a work type:
  0 - Whatever makes the most sense
  100 - First time LL tests
  102 - World record LL tests
  101 - Double-check LL tests
  150 - First time PRP tests
  152 - World record PRP tests
  151 - Double-check PRP tests
  2 - Trial factoring
  4 - P-1 factoring
  153 - 100 million digit PRP tests
  104 - 100 million digit LL tests (not recommended)
  160 - First time PRP on Mersenne cofactors
  161 - Double-check PRP on Mersenne cofactors
  5 - ECM for first factors of Mersenne numbers
  8 - ECM on Mersenne cofactors
  6 - ECM on Fermat numbers
  1 - Trial factoring to low limits

Type of work to get (0): 102
CPU cores to use (multithreading) (2): 
Use hyperthreading for trial factoring (recommended) (Y): 
Use hyperthreading for LL, P-1, ECM (not recommended) (N):
