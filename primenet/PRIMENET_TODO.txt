PRIMENET TODO

*GOALS*

~1) When using the v5 API (`submit_one_line_v5` and maybe `submit_one_line`?), we need to extract the values required for the `ar` endpoint for CUDALucas.~

~2) Grab the progress + report it from the file indicated in the `-g/--gpu` flag.~

~3) Throw an error when CUDALucas attempts to get PRP assignments.~


*STRETCH GOALS*
1) Unreserve all function
2) (N/A?) Take out duplication of the return code printing in `register_instance`, `submit_one_line_v5` and `send_progress`.
3) Do more based off of the errors received back
4) Add in system info + `psutil` stuff that makes it work for all OS types.
5) Cleanup/optimize code

***********UP TO DATE*********************
I think the priorities are:
1) grab the info from a cudalucas file to REPORT a work assignment with the AR endpoint (submit_one_line_v5)
2) grab the info from a cudalucas file to UPDATE a work assignment with the AP endpoint (submit_progress)
